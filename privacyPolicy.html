This information is anonymous and is gathered through our servers' log files. This information is used for internal review, to tailor information to individual visitors and for Web site traffic audits. We also may provide this information (as well as information from third-party market researchers) about our users on an aggregated, anonymous basis to our affiliates and strategic partners.
</p>
<p><strong>2. What personally identifiable information is collected from me?</strong><br/>
We only solicit personal information from Web site visitors on a voluntary basis. On certain Web pages of Prestige Brands or its specific brands, you can make requests and/or receive materials. The types of personal information collected at these pages are your name, e-mail address and standard contact information, including addresses and phone numbers. We may also ask you to voluntarily provide us with information regarding your personal or professional interests, demographics, experience with the products and services we provide, product preferences, and contact preferences. Prestige Brands does not require this information to obtain access to any part of our Web site. Prestige Brands has no intention of collecting any personal data from individuals under 13 years of age.

If you do not want to receive such mailings, simply "opt-out" by the means provided for in the mailings. If you have communicated with us through this Web site and wish to have personal information removed, please write us at:<br/></p>

<p><strong>4. What are cookies and how are they used by Prestige Brands?</strong>
Prestige Brands may place Internet cookies on your hard drive. Internet cookies are small files that may be placed on your hard disk for record-keeping purposes. Cookies are used to (a) remind us of who you are in order to deliver you better service; (b) estimate our audience size by determining repeat usage of the Web site to help target advertisements based on user interests and behavior; (c) track your progress and entries in promotions, sweepstakes and contests, if any; and (d) measure certain traffic patterns for use as a research tool to understand how our users' habits are similar or different from one another. You can set your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie, giving you the chance to decide whether or not to accept it. By not accepting cookies, some Web pages may not display properly or you may not be permitted to access certain information. Prestige Brands may also collect IP addresses (the Internet address of a computer) to track a user's session while the user remains anonymous. We analyze this data for certain trends in statistics, such as which parts of our site users are visiting and how long they spend there. In general, we do not link your IP addresses to anything personally identifiable to you.
</p>
<p><strong>5. Who is collecting my information?</strong>
When you are on a Prestige Brands site and are asked for personal information, you are sharing that information with Prestige Brands alone, unless specifically stated otherwise. If data is being collected and/or maintained by any company other than Prestige Brands or an agent for Prestige Brands, you will be notified prior to the time of the data collection or transfer. If you do not want your data to be shared, you can choose not to allow the transfer by not using that particular service or purchasing those particular products.
Please be aware that Prestige Brands advertisers or Web sites that have links on our site may collect personally identifiable information about you. The information practices of those Web sites linked to Prestige Brands either through advertisements or other hyperlinks are not covered by this Privacy Statement.

Except as provided above or in the event of a merger, consolidation, or sale of all or substantially all of Prestige Brands’ assets, we will not share any of your information with any third party without your permission.

<p><strong>8. What does "opt-out" mean?</strong><br/>
To "opt-out" means that you have notified Prestige Brands that we no longer have permission to use your information for a particular purpose. For example, when we send you information on a new product, you will be given the opportunity to "opt-out" of receiving such information in the future.
</p>
<p><strong>9. What happens when I leave prestigebrandsinc.com to visit a linked site?</strong><br/>
Parts of the Web site include hyperlinks to the sites of other companies. When you leave prestigebrandsinc.com to visit one of these sites, the only information transferred to the third party is the fact that you came from prestigebrandsinc.com. This practice allows the third party to monitor its own Web site traffic, but does not provide it with any information about you. Prestige Brands is not responsible or liable for the independent privacy policies of third party Web sites. You should consult the privacy policies at third party Web sites to determine how your information may be used.
</p>
 <p><strong>10. What happens if I e-mail Prestige Brands?</strong><br/>
Prestige Brands may provide e-mail links on its Web sites to further facilitate communication between Prestige Brands and you. Information collected through electronic mail may be shared with our customer service department, employees or other third parties that perform services on our behalf. Unless otherwise noted, electronic mail on our site is not a completely secure and confidential means of communication. Non-encrypted electronic communications may be accessed and viewed by other Internet users without your knowledge or permission while in transit to us. Therefore, we recommend that you contact us by phone using one of the numbers found on our Web sites whenever you are communicating personal information to us.
</p> 
<p><strong>11. Is my information secure?</strong><br/>
Prestige Brands has taken measures to keep all information from our online visitors as secure as possible against any unauthorized access or use. All information is protected by standard security measures which are periodically reviewed. Unless otherwise noted, electronic mail on our site is not a completely secure and confidential means of communication. Non-encrypted electronic communications may be accessed and viewed by other Internet users without your knowledge or permission while in transit to us.
</p> 
<p><strong>12. How do I contact Prestige Brands?</strong><br/>
We can be reached via our Contact Us page.
</p>
<p><strong>13. What else should I know about my privacy?</strong><br/>
Third party Internet sites and services accessible through Prestige Brands have separate privacy and data collection practices, independent of us. Prestige Brands has no responsibility or liability for these independent policies or actions. Please be careful and responsible online. If you post personal information online that is accessible to the public, you may receive unsolicited messages from other parties in return. While we strive to protect your information, Prestige Brands cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information through the transmission process and you do so at your own risk.
</p>  
<p><strong>14. Notice regarding changes to Privacy Statement.</strong><br/>
